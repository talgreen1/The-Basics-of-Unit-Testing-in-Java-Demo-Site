# The Basics of Unit Testing in Java - Demo Site

This project is a demo site, both front end and back end.
The front end uses Angular and the back end uses Spring.

The site simulates a small book store. 

## How to run

### Running the back end

### Running the front end
1. Install node.js
2. From command line: open the directory '**UnitTestUI**'
3. Build the front end: '**npm install**'
4. type '**ng serve**'. This will start the front end on localhost:4200
